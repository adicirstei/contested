# The fxhash contested pieces.

I decided to publish the two pieces that fxhash moderators considered to be copymints and flagged them as mallicious.

This repo is for anyone to be able to take a look at the code and decide for themselves if there is anything stolen here.

The first contested piece was Rags. It was built in last December and from the get go I mentioned Ben Kovach as the inspiration. I'm not sure what code thief would do such a thing. 

The second one is the recent Gradatim, which I consider just remotely inspired by Rich Poole's Kakano. 

Anyway, if you want to run the sketches, get the repo, install dependencies and `serve` the sketches. (You will need nodejs)


Install dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```


Run the sketch:
```bash
npm run serve "./src/rags.js"

# or 

npm run serve "./src/gradatim.js"
```
